# Image-Classification-using-CNN

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of cats and dogs. The goal is to develop a model capable of accurately distinguishing between these two classes of animals based on the input images.

## Overview

The project consists of the following main components:

1. **Dataset Preparation**: The dataset comprises images of cats and dogs. These images are organized into training and validation sets.

2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A CNN architecture is designed and implemented using Keras. The model consists of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, dropout layers, and dense layers.

3. **Model Training**: The CNN model is trained using the training set and validated using the validation set. Training parameters such as epochs and batch size are specified.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy.

5. **Saving the Model**: Once trained, the model is saved for future use.
